# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

This logo generator creates a customized SVG image file. The user can choose between three shapes (circle, square, triangle) with custom colors and up to 3 characters.

Node.js, inquirer.js, and object-oriented programming (specifically classes) were utilized to form interconnected files and code.

## Installation

If Node.js is not already installed in your system, you can get it at <https://nodejs.org>. Once installed, download the files in the repository. The files can then be accessed/opened in a command line window (either Command Prompt, Terminal, or Git Bash depending on what your system & what you have installed).

## Usage

Open the folder containing the files via command line window. Type "node index.js", then answer the prompts to generate an SVG logo file in the same folder.
